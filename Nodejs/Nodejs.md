# NodeJs

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous
### Synchronous:-  
    -Code is excute line b line.
    -Each operation waits for the previous one to finish before continue.  
    -slower if there are somthing that task takes time.
    exmaple.
    const data = fs.readFileSync("file name");

### Asynchronous:-
    -code runs without waiting.
    -times-consuming tasks run in the backgroud.  
    -Allows other tasks to run waile waiting for one to finish.
    -Good for performance, escpecially in the web servers.

| Modularity                     | Breaking code into small functions         |
| CLI commands (`node todo.js`)  | Building terminal-based tools              |


## Core Concept:- 

### http Modlue:- 
    -it create a web server.  
    -Used to handle incoming HTTP request
